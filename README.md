# Image-Gallery

Description: Developed a simple image gallery
application that displays a grid of images with the
ability to view each image in a modal or lightbox.
Implemented:
1. Created React components for the image gallery, individual
images, and the modal/lightbox.
2. Used React state (useState hook) to manage the currently
selected image in the modal.
3. Implemented event handlers to open and close the modal and
navigate between images.
4 Styled the image gallery and modal using CSS for a visually
appealing presentation.
